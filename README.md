## 🔍 Overview

RRN integrates two jointly trained components: a Reparametrization model, which extracts a low-dimensional latent representation of the input space, and a Regression model, which maps this representation to the target output. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on correlations among input variables, RRN effectively handles weakly correlated or uncorrelated inputs, making it particularly well-suited for high-dimensional engineering problems. When benchmarked against a baseline combining an AutoEncoder and an ANN-based surrogate model, RRN demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness. By leveraging input–output relationships rather than depending on internal input correlations, RRN offers a new paradigm in combined dimension reduction and surrogate modeling—especially valuable in design scenarios where data is generated using space-filling techniques such as Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).

  abstract = {In aerodynamic shape optimization, dimension reduction and surrogate modeling are widely recognized for their potential to reduce the computational cost and time associated with computational fluid dynamics simulations and, subsequently, the numerical optimization process. This article introduces a novel unsupervised learning framework called the Reparameterization and Regression Network (RRN). The RRN is designed to simultaneously perform variable transformation for selective dimension reduction and surrogate modeling while constructing a regression model. The model comprises two interdependent sub-models: the reparameterization model, which transforms selected features, and the regression model, which predicts outputs based on the transformed features. Both components are trained jointly using a dataset of input variables and their corresponding outputs. The proposed approach excels in reducing the dimensionality of weakly correlated data while improving the predictive accuracy of surrogate models. Furthermore, it has proven effective and reliable for applications in deterministic and robust optimization. This capability is demonstrated through the aerodynamic optimization of a transonic wing parameterized using the free-form deformation technique.}
